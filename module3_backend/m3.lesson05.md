### Prep
* [Express with MongoDB](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZKwrOXl5TDI)
* [Express with Mongoose](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h4A0-53Olm4)
* [data-models-relationships](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/applications/data-models-relationships/)

### Agenda
1. Preparations
2. Queries
3. Aggregation
4. NoSql data-modeling
5. CRUD practice

---
### Preparations
data to our DB will be importet from json files.
We'll use [openfootball](https://github.com/openfootball/football.json/) data.
You can find them in your json folder
* review the app infrastructure
* [mongoimport](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/program/mongoimport/#use) is a tool provided with mongoDB to import content



---
### Preparations
example:
```
mongoimport --db users --collection contacts --file contacts.json
```
users is our db, contacts is our collection, contacts.json is the file we want to load data from
* we can use the *drop* flag to drop previously loaded data
* import *rounds* data from json file
```
mongoimport --db football --collection rounds --drop --file rounds.json --jsonArray
```
* create *clubs* collection and add *clubs* data
* make sure data was loaded to your db correctly

---
### Reminder: [Query and Projection](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/query/)
```
db.collection.find(query, projection);
```
queries can be composed in a javascript-like syntax:
```
// COMPARISON
db.collection.find({field: {$in: ['value1', 'value2']}}
// LOGICAL
db.collection.find({$or: [{"field": "value1"}, {"field": "value2"}]})
```

see [the docs](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/project-fields-from-query-results/)

---
### Practice Queries
Mongo queries
practics in shell
* get club with name equal "Burnley"
* get club with name equal "Burnley" or "Chelsea"
* get all clubs other than "Chelsea"
* get all clubs with name that include 'b' or 'B'
* for all clubs that include b/B, add field "hasB:true"


---
### Practice Queries (answers)
```
db.clubs.find({"name": "Burnley"})

db.clubs.find({$or: [{"name": "Burnley"}, {"name": "Chelsea"}]})
or
db.clubs.find({"name" : {$in: ["Burnley", "Chelsea"]}})

db.clubs.find({"name": {$ne: ["Chelsea"]}})

db.clubs.find({"name": {$regex : /b/i}})
Or
db.clubs.find({"name":/b/i})

db.clubs.updateMany({"name":/b/i}, {$set: {"hasB": true}})
```

---
### The problem with complex data

* On matchday 1, show only matches when both teams scores at least 1 goal.

---
### The problem with complex data

what this query return, and why?
```
db.rounds.find({
    "name": "Matchday 1",
    "matches": {
        $elemMatch: {
            "score1": {$gte: 1} ,
            "score2": {$gte: 1}
        }
    }
})
```
---
### The problem with complex data

what this query return, and why?
```
db.rounds.find({
    "matches": {
        $elemMatch: {
            "score1": 2 ,
            "score2": 2
        }
    }
}, { "matches": 0})
```

---
### [Aggregation](https://www.tutorialspoint.com/mongodb/mongodb_aggregation.htm)
For dealing with complex data - we'll need to aggrigate stages.
Think about it as making a **find** action, than passing it to another **find**.
Each stage must start with [stage operator](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation-pipeline/).

Tip: Compass provide an effective UI tool for creating aggregation

How should we solve the following tasks?
* Count how many matchedays ended had a game with result of 2:2

---
### Aggregation (answer)
* Count how many matchedays ended had a game with result of 2:2
```
db.rounds.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            "matches": {
                $elemMatch: {
                    "score1": 2 ,
                    "score2": 2
            }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      $count: "tie_2_2"
    }
  ])
```

---
### Practice Aggregation
* Count how many matchedays ended with at least 5 goals for team 1

---
### Practice Aggregation (answer)
* Count how many matchedays ended with at least 5 goals for team 1
```
db.rounds.aggregate([
    {
        $match: {
            "matches": {
                $elemMatch: {
                    "score1": { $gte: 5 }
            }
        }
      }
    },
    {
      $count: "team1_score_at_least_5"
    }
  ])
```

### Practice Aggregation - 2
* On matchday 1, show only matches when team1 scores at least 3 goals.

---
### Practice Aggregation - 2 (answers)
```
db.rounds.aggregate([
    {$match: {"name": "Matchday 1"}},
    {
        $project : {
            "matches": {
                  $filter: {
                     input: "$matches",
                     as: "mt",
                     cond: { $gte: [ "$$mt.score1", 3 ] }
                  }
            }
        }
    }
])
```

---
### Practice Aggregation - Food for thoughts
What about this?
* find the team which has the most goals for the season
* show all matchdays when Manchester United wins. show the matchday name and the game score.
* get matchdays 1 - 4 : what will the following result? how to solve it?
```
db.rounds.find({}, {"matches": 0}).sort({"name":1}).limit(4)
```

---
### NoSql data-modeling
What if all matches would be in a single array? can we do it without lossing data?
```
{
    "matchday": 1,
    "date": "2016-08-15",
    "team1": {...},
    "team2": {...},
    "score1": 2,
    "score2": 1
}
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
---
### NoSql data-modeling
* What about postponed matchdays?
```
{
    "matchday": 1,
    "postponed": false,
    "date": "2016-08-15",
    "team1": {...},
    "team2": {...},
    "score1": 2,
    "score2": 1
}
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
---
### NoSql data-modeling
* Format the data with the new structure and reload data to DB.
you can use node.js for formatting the data.
* Query for matches when both teams scores at least 1 goal.
* Query for matches when both teams scores at least 1 goal on matchday 1.
* Get matchdays 1 - 4

* The [advantages](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/data-model-design/#data-modeling-embedding) for each method

---
### NoSql data-modeling - practice
* Create a DB with publishers and books collections
* Insert the data from the [Document References example](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/tutorial/model-referenced-one-to-many-relationships-between-documents/)
* Fetch book with publisher data using [$lookup](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/reference/operator/aggregation/lookup/)
* Fetch publisher with books data
* do the same for football clubs data

---
### NoSql data-modeling (answer)
```
db.books.aggregate([
   {
     $lookup:
       {
         from: "publishers",
         localField: "publisher_id",
         foreignField: "_id",
         as: "publisher"
       }
  }
])
```
---
### NoSql data-modeling (answer)
```
db.publishers.aggregate([
   {
     $lookup:
       {
         from: "books",
         localField: "_id",
         foreignField: "publisher_id",
         as: "books"
       }
  }
])
```
---
### Last DB notes
* [indexing](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/indexes/index.html)
* [multi document transactions](https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/core/transactions/#transactions-and-replica-sets)

---
### CRUD practice
* Replace static data with data from DB
* implement CRUD for clubs collections
* deletion will remove all matches from rounds collection
* update will change all data in round collection
