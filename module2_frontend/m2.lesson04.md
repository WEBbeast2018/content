## Module 2 Lesson 4
### Angular Advanced 1/2
(This document is optimized for presentation using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md))

---

### Prep
* Finish Angular 101 Workshop (lessons 2-3)
* watch [Zones minutes 1-10](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3IqtmUscE_U)
* watch 1 minute of video about [change detection (17:44-18:50)](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=X0DLP_rktsc)

---

### Agenda
1. Review the Theory
2. Under the hood
3. Component Interaction
4. NgGoodies
5. Getting Data via HTTP

---

### Review the Theory
* Frame-work: write code in a certian way to save work
* Examples: components, data-view binding, routing, pre-configured tools

---

### Review the Theory - Angular got your back
* You change the data, Angular will take care of the change detection
* Write component once, use it many times
* Bind paths to components, Angular simulate the routing
* Linter, Tests, typescript, rxjs - all ready to use

---

### Under the hood - Angular Compiler
* Angular Compilation: make your code into something the browser can process
* After compilation - everything is JS (not html files besides index.html)
* Dev build != prod build (AoT, Hashcode, vendors script)
* Extra: [Deep dive to the angular compiler](https://blog.angularindepth.com/a-deep-deep-deep-deep-deep-dive-into-the-angular-compiler-5379171ffb7a)
* Demo and Practice: do ng build and serve using http-server
```
    ng build
    cd dist
    http-server
```

---

### Under the hood - [lifecycle hooks](https://angular.io/guide/lifecycle-hooks)

lifecycle hooks
(ex: minimal app - console log hooks)

---

### Under the hood - change detection
(ex: minimal app - change to onPush + mark for check)

---

### Under the hood - ngmodule: importing PrimeNg, explain ngmodule decorators

---

### Under the hood - encapsulation (see css effects only on host, see css selectors)
---

### Under the hood - data-binding (1/2 ways)

---

### Component Interaction
---

### NgGoodies - Pipes
### NgGoodies - Forms
NgGoodies-forms
practice:
change city name to upper case
in car app, change Workshop details to using form + validation

<!-- 1. Component Interaction | input-output | services -->
<!-- 2. NgGoodies, Pipes, Forms, cheetsheet -->
<!-- 3. Intoduction to RXjs: Observables -->

<!-- data-binding (1/2 ways) -->
<!-- +cheetsheet -->

<!-- Component Interaction | input-output | services | get native (containerRef / Element Ref with #) -->
<!-- (ex: input-output scenario,Element Ref scenario) -->



<!-- http advanced with rxjs -->
<!-- fetch typicode posts and present them -->
