## What is Reactive Programming?
* Reactive programming is programming with __asynchronous data streams__.
* Anything can be a 'data stream' - clicks, variables, HTTP requests etc...
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Change of approach - sync programming vs async
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Think about taking the concept of Promise to the next level

## The Marvel of Marbles
data / events stream usually explained by __marbles__:

```
    --a---b-c---d---X---|->

    a, b, c, d are emitted values
    X is an error
    | is the 'completed' signal
    ---> is the timeline
```
