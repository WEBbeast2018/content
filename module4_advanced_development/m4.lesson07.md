### What is Data Security?
* The means of ensuring that data is safe
* From what? - corruption / unauthorized access / Both
* Information Security - Preserving information availability, confidentiality and integrity

---
### [Attack types](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Category:Attack)(very partial list)
* Dos / DDos
* Eavesdropping
* Injections
* XSS and CSRF
* Brute Force
* Trojans in npm


---
### [Dos / DDos](https://he.wikipedia.org/wiki/%D7%94%D7%AA%D7%A7%D7%A4%D7%AA_%D7%9E%D7%A0%D7%99%D7%A2%D7%AA_%D7%A9%D7%99%D7%A8%D7%95%D7%AA)
* Problem: creating overload on the system cause denial-of-service
* [Defense techniques](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denial-of-service_attack#Defense_techniques)

---

### Eavesdropping
* HTTPS (TLS 1.2)

---
### Injections
* Problem: giving users unauthorized access
* [SQL injections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=h-9rHTLHJTY)
* [NoSQL injections](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FcoecqFUjeU)
* Solution - validation on the server (see joi and mongoose.validation)

---

### XSS and CSRF
* [XSS](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cbmBDiR6WaY)
* [XSRF / CSRF](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vRBihr41JTo)
* [CORS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/HTTP/CORS)

### Brute Force
* practice time
* [how not to use reCAPTCHA](https://internet-israel.com/%D7%A8%D7%A9%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%90%D7%99%D7%A0%D7%98%D7%A8%D7%A0%D7%98/%D7%91%D7%90%D7%92-%D7%90%D7%91%D7%98%D7%97%D7%94-%D7%A7%D7%A8%D7%99%D7%98%D7%99-%D7%91%D7%90%D7%AA%D7%A8-%D7%A9%D7%9C-%D7%9E%D7%A4%D7%9C%D7%92%D7%AA-%D7%94%D7%A2%D7%91%D7%95%D7%93%D7%94/)

### Trojans in npm
* [I’m harvesting credit card numbers and passwords from your site](https://hackernoon.com/im-harvesting-credit-card-numbers-and-passwords-from-your-site-here-s-how-9a8cb347c5b5)
* Use well known packages (or at least open source with public build process)
* [Snyk](https://snyk.io/docs/using-snyk/?utm_campaign=docs&utm_medium=github&utm_source=full_docs)

---
### How NOT to Store Passwords
* [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8ZtInClXe1Q)
* Bcrypt
* About [old hashing functions](https://www.md5online.org/)

---
### Final words
* Your client code is public (minification is not a solution)
* Read and keep up-to-date
* Check with [OWASP](https://www.owasp.org/index.php/Main_Page)
* use [online test tools](https://www.ssllabs.com)
* Think like a Hacker which trying to get you
* Use multiple security layers (client is not considered as a layer)
