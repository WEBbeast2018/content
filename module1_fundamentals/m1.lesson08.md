### Prep
* [https://codeplanet.io/introduction-to-lodash/](https://codeplanet.io/introduction-to-lodash/)

### Agenda
1. Libraries and Docs: Learning to learn
2. What is a template engine?
3. Using Handlebars template engine
4. Lodash: A JavaScript utility library
5. A taste of Advanced JS libraries (D3, ThreeJS)

### Libraries and Docs: Learning to learn

1. get an overview (For a totally new subject)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

2. perform very basic task. popular libraries usually provide a documented "Quick start" (For a totally new subject)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

3. make sure you know what you are looking for ([duck-debug](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rubber_duck_debugging) may help)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

4. use google with keywords, general to specific (like: js, Handlebars, some task  / functionality)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Libraries and Docs: Learning to learn
go to resources (here are some common results)
- stack overflow - mostly specific and right to the point
- w3school - great for getting short and specific data
- MDN - very professional data, include reference for standard, specs, compatibility etc
- Item specific docs - Angular, JQuery, Lodash etc.
- Medium / Hacker noon etc. - Many posts / elaborated articles written mostly by professional
- github / npm - most likely will hold some docs or link to docs, and the source.

### What is a template engine?
```html
<div>
  <h1>{{title}}</h1>
  <div>
    {{body}}
  </div>
</div>
```
* a software designed to combine templates with a data model
* help to make data/view separation
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* no need for manual data injections as in native templates
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* intuitive (similar concept to DOM manipulation via html templates)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template engine
* [tryhandlebarsjs](http://tryhandlebarsjs.com/)
* Live Demo
    - [add Handlebars CDN](https://handlebarsjs.com/installation.html)
    - use templates to display data

---

### Using [Handlebars](https://handlebarsjs.com/) template engine - practice
* use Handlebars to display flights in our past flights app exercise (lessons 5-6)
* PR to class-practice repo

---

### Lodash: A JavaScript utility library
* ***Utility library*** provide functionality for common tasks
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* examples:  sorting, cloning, filtering, mapping  etc.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Lodash vs Underscore (vs Ramda vs whatever...) 
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Lodash exist since 2012 - some of it's functionality already have [native support](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Lodash-Underscore)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### Lodash: A JavaScript utility library
* Basic concept: pass data, then predicate (if needed/supported)
* [sort](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#sortBy)
* [clone](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#clone)
* [filter](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#filter)
* [map](https://lodash.com/docs/4.17.5#map)
* and many, many more

---

### Lodash: A JavaScript utility library - Practice
* Live Short Demo
* use Lodash sort and filter flights in our past flights app exercise (lessons 5-6)
* bonus: add text filter (search in the entire flight object)

---

### A taste of Advanced JS libraries (D3, ThreeJS)
* [ThreeJS](https://threejs.org/) 
    - [earth 2050](https://2050.earth/)
    - [infinitown](http://demos.littleworkshop.fr/infinitown)
    - [threeJS-simple-demo](https://github.com/yuvalbl/threeJS-simple-demo)
* [D3](https://d3js.org/) 
    - [piechard demo](http://bl.ocks.org/nadinesk/99393098950665c471e035ac517c2224) 
    - [tutorial](http://christopheviau.com/d3_tutorial/)

### Further reading
* Play with the code demos in [A Beginnerâ€™s Guide to Handlebars](https://www.sitepoint.com/a-beginners-guide-to-Handlebars/)
* [You don't (may not) need Lodash](https://github.com/you-dont-need/You-Dont-Need-Lodash-Underscore)

HW:
* finish wack a mole game - you may use Handlebars and Lodash if you like
* Finish class practice for flights app
* need any extra / short exercises?
