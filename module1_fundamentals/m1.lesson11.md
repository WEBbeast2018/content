### OOP: what and why?
* As program grows, code can become messy, unless you have a strong coding paradigm
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* OOP: the usage of "Objects" to organize code by context
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* <!-- .element: class="fragment" --> organize data and function around "object" make it:
    - more intuitive
    - more coherent

Functional Programming

```js
const baseSalary = 10000;
const overtime = 20;
const overtimeRate = 55;

function getWage(baseSalary, overtime, overtimeRate) {
    return baseSalary + (overtime * overtimeRate);
}
```

---

Object Oriented Programming

```js
const employee = {
    baseSalary: 10000;
    overtime: 20;
    overtimeRate: 55;

    // look! parameterless function!
    getWage: function() {
        return this.baseSalary + (this.overtime * this.overtimeRate);
    };
}
```

---

* You can still use functional programming.
* Objects can be a parameter for a function
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->Allow chaining by returning Objects (Like: Promise.then, [Lodash Chain](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide#capped-iteratee-arguments))
* <!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
Allow chaining by returning functions (Like: [Lodash FP](https://github.com/lodash/lodash/wiki/FP-Guide#capped-iteratee-arguments) [-2-](https://medium.com/making-internets/why-using-chain-is-a-mistake-9bc1f80d51ba) )

```
    // Chaining by returning Object
    fetch('url').then(a => a).then(b => b);

    // Chaining by returning Function
    function fooFactory(num) {
        const base = num;
        return function(power) {
            return base ** power;
        }
    }

    fooFactory(5)(3);
```
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---


When to use Object Oriented approache?
* If data and functions can be logically gathered around "a thing" in the real world - use objects
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Objects: characters, users, items, events etc.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Don't force OOP when not reuired
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

OOP Pillars:
* Encapsulation
* Abstracion
* Inheritace
* Polymorphism

### A story about javascript school (1)

Moshe is a web developer. For the last 6 years he's building and mantaining codebase for
a javascript academy (the original code was written in es5).
Zrubavel, His messy, annoying superviser, add new, unplanned requirements
for the acadamy managing system from time to time.
help Moshe to complete his task and achive inner peace.



---

### [The early days (Before ES6)](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/JavaScript/Objects/Object-oriented_JS)
```
function Person(first, last, age) {
    //private members
    var _firstName = first;
    var _lastName = last;
    // public
    this.age = age;
    this.getName = function() {
        return _firstName + ' ' + _lastName;
    };
}

Person.prototype.toString = function() {
    return this.getName() + 'is ' + this.age + ' years old.';
};

var moshe = new Person('David', 'Levi', 40);
```
---

### Javascript school (2)
"Moshe!" cried Zrubavel, "our database contain only data about teachers
but not for students! this is a disaster!".
Zrubavel turned to face the window, and with his back to Moshe said to himself:
"Plus, it would be great if each object could declare it's data with toString
method, it's a total mess out there..."

"OK" replied Moshe and turned to his screen.
Help Moshe complete his task using Functions and Porotoype.

---

### ES6 wrapping
```js
class Person {
    constructor(first, last, age, gender) {
        // private (convension only)
        this._firstName = first;
        this._lastName = last;

        // public
        this.age = age;
        this.gender = gender;
    }

    getName() {
        return this._firstName + ' ' + this._lastName;
    }

    toString() {
        const genderStr = (this.gender === 'M') ? 'Male' : 'Female';
        return `${this.getName()} is  ${this.age} ${genderStr}`;
    };
}
```

---

###  Javascript school (3)
"We've launched a new training program" said Zrubavel. "each new teacher will first be a `Trainee`,
and will be an apprentice to more experinced teacher - A Professor. I need you to write the code. O', and make it es6 will ya?"

With his back to Moshe Zrubavel said to himself:
"Plus, it would be great if we can print the list of Professor-Trainee
pairs whenever we want..."

"Whatever" replied Moshe and turned to his screen.
Help him complete his task using classes.

---

### [Typescript](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/07/learn-typescript-in-30-minutes) OOP
```js
abstract class Person {
    private readonly firstName: string;
    private readonly lastName: string;
    public age: number;

    protected constructor(first: string, last: string, age:number) {
        // private
        this.firstName = first;
        this.lastName = last;
        // public
        this.age = age;
    }

    getName(): string {
        return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
    }
}
```
---

### [Typescript](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/07/learn-typescript-in-30-minutes) OOP
```ts
interface HasName {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    getName(): string;
}

interface HasAge {
    age: number;
}

class Person implements HasName, HasAge {
    // must have properties firstName lastName and age
    // must have function getName (no params, return string)
}
```
---

### [Typescript](https://tutorialzine.com/2016/07/learn-typescript-in-30-minutes) OOP
```ts
interface HasName {
    firstName: string;
    lastName: string;
    getName(): string;
}


function createPerson(first: string, last: string):  HasName {
    // return object wich implement HasName
    return {
        firstName: first,
        lastName: last,
        getName: function() {
            return this.firstName + ' ' + this.lastName;
        };
    }
}
```

---

### Javascript school (4)
"Moshe!" cried Zrubavel,
"Anybody can type whatever
they want as parameters! The new guy just shutdown the whole system
by providing name of a new teach to be 'Null!' this is a disaster!"

Zrubavel turned to face the window, and with his back to Moshe said to himself:
"Plus, it would be great if we could prevent new developers from using
super classes directly..."

"Sure" replied Moshe and turned to his screen.
Help Moshe complete his task using Typescript.
