### <a href="./demo/m1.lesson01/my-first-page.html" target="_blank">Hello HTML</a>
HTML rules and semantics
- they are so many of them... don't get confused!
- [doctype](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_doctype.asp)
- head ([base](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_base.asp), [meta](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_meta.asp), [title](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_title.asp), [link](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_link.asp), [script](https://www.w3schools.com/tags/tag_script.asp))
- body
    - flow ( [block vs inline](https://www.w3schools.com/html/html_blocks.asp) )
    - elements semantics (`a`,`img`, lists, `header`, `footer`, `nav`,`h1`-`h6`, `p`, `i`, `div`, `span`, `select`, `input` etc)

---

### Hello CSS
- Cascading means...?
- CSS [selectors and points](https://css-tricks.com/specifics-on-css-specificity/)
- display property (again - block vs inline, none, and more!)
- [box model](https://www.w3schools.com/css/css_boxmodel.asp)
- body
    - flow (block vs inline)
    - elements semantics (h1-6, p, div, span etc)



---

### Hello HTML + CSS: Class Practice
Create and style a page which contains:
- head title
- a question line
- 5-8 lines of texts (answer option)
- input + button
<div>
    <img src="./assets/trivia.png">
</div>



---

### Hello Javascript
- good practice: use strict, always terminate statements. compare by type.
- Data types: Undefined, Null, Boolean, Number, String, Symbol, Object 
- Variables: var / const / let
- Loops: while, for, forEach (avoid using for in)
- Comparing types
- Objects: literals, constructor, nested properties
- Arrays
- Functions
- DOM

---

### Hello Javascript: Class Practice
Add dynamic page render to the Trivia page
Add input with number type, an answer button and correct / wrong indication.

---

### Hello git
<div style="float: left">
    <img src="./assets/git-branch.jpg">
</div>
important terms:

commit, branch, master, merge, local repository

---

### Hello git
important terms:
- current branch / HEAD
- fork
- clone
- pull / push
- downstream / upstream 
- stash
- [conflicts](https://help.github.com/articles/resolving-a-merge-conflict-using-the-command-line/)

---

### Hello git - Working with PRs
1. fork repo class-practice
2. clone the repo to your local machine: 
```
git clone https://github.com/MY_NAME/class-practice
```
3. create branch:   ***git checkout -b MY_NAME***
4. make changes
5. add changes to git:    ***git add -A***
6. commit changes: ***git commit -m "MY FIRST COMMIT"***
7. push to your repo:  ***git push origin MY_NAME***
8. open PR to origin ('upstream') repo


---

### Hello git - Working with PRs
keep in mind:
- change only your card content (you can add images)
- have a unique branch name (use your name)
- for now, avoid manual [merge](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=AqocDsE_32c)
