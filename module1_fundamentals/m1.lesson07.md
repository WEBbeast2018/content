---

### Chrome Advanced debugging
* Elements Tab, styles and breakpoints
* Console
* Network
* Sources (page and extensions)

---

### Reversed engineering with dev-tools
target website: http://www.mima.co.il. find out:
* What is the (likely) web server programming language?
* Are requests async / sync ?
* what other services the websites uses? (cdn, analytics etc.)
* What does "random search" button do"?
* What does "Search by User Input" button do"?

---

### Reversed engineering with dev-tools
target website: http://www.ynet.co.il/. find out:
* Which type of jquery version is being used?
* what is the domain for images?
* How would you improve the buttons section at the top of the page?

---


### JQuery basics - what is it?
* Write less, do more library
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Originally designed for cross-browsing
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Using Css-based queries
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Provide effective AJAX wrapper
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Since modern Browser are comply with standard and provide good DOM navigation functions - why should we use it?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---

### JQuery basics - why learn it in at 2018?
* You most likely to bump into it online
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* You most likely have to work with it, as many projects use it.
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Backward compatibility (designed for cross-browsing)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* May offer a good solution for some projects (mainly small projects)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Support easy and fast-to-write UI solutions (Animations/Fade, JQuery UI)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Good extensibility (plugins support)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---


### JQuery basics - [adding to a project](https://jquery.com/download/)
* Adding JQuery as a file (minified vs unminified)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* Adding JQuery (or any library) with CDN
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* A word about CDN
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* The modern option: using a package manager
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---


### JQuery basics - document.ready
To make sure the document is full loaded, we'll use document ready event
```js
$(document).ready(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});
```
Shorthand method
```js
$(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});
```
Since entire page is loaded - JQuery script can be placed anywhere (event in the head section)

---


### JQuery basics - the main concept
* you select elements (using selectors), the perform an action on them
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* you can chain actions and selectors
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* make sure you have the correct selectors, especially when chaining
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

* empty selectors do not raise an error (they are valid)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---


### JQuery basics - [selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp)

```
$("button").hide();         // hide all buttons
$("button.primary").hide(); // hide all buttons with class primary
$("tr:even").hide();        // hide all even tr's

// hide all links with target equals "_blank"
$("a[target='_blank']").hide();
// hide all links with target NOT equals "_blank"
$("a[target!='_blank']").hide(); 
```
Style Guide:
[jQuery selectors uses double quotes](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/#quotes)

---

### JQuery basics - [Events](http://api.jquery.com/on/)
```js
$("p").on("click", function(){
    $(this).hide();
});
```
Or - shorthand version:
```js
$("p").click(function(){
    $(this).hide();
});
```
Triggering event:
```js
$("button:first").click();
```

### [JQuery basics](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/default.asp)
* [DOM manipulation](http://api.jquery.com/category/manipulation/)
* [Effects](http://api.jquery.com/category/effects/)
* [Traversing](http://api.jquery.com/category/traversing/)
* [AJAX](http://api.jquery.com/category/ajax/)

### JQuery basics - Practice time
* Live Demo (add JQuery CDN and DOM manipulation)

* Build wack-a-mole using JQuery
    - start with 6X6 board (you can reuse code from memory-cards game)
    - 4 moles will appear [randomly](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/2380019/generate-unique-random-numbers-between-1-and-100) at the board, and disappear after  1 second
    - every 'hit' will append 1 to user scores
    - Bonus (only after completing basic version) - add easy/medium/hard levels
---
  
### Review [JQuery repository](https://github.com/jquery/jquery)
Key notes
* see how [it works](https://ajax.googleapis.com/ajax/libs/jquery/3.3.1/jquery.js)
* splitting code to modules
* watch for documentation comments
* style guide
* zen hub, issues and PR
* See query returned Object (with dev-tools)

---
  
###  Let's build [JQuery Plugins](https://learn.jquery.com/plugins/basic-plugin-creation/)
* Overview
* Practice
    - create a plugin which add a 20x20 px div to the DOM as a child
    - child will be hidden first, and become visible after 1 second;
    - bonus: child will be removed from DOM after 2 seconds

* [Advanced Techniques with Chrome Devtools](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zmbBIF2Xecs&t=4s)
* [What is a Content Delivery Network? (CDN)](https://blog.stackpath.com/glossary/cdn/)

HW:
* finish  wack-a-mole game
* create and use "moleify" plugin  which:
    - show a "mole" to the DOM for X seconds
    - if not click by that time - remove from DOM
    - if clicked - invoke a callback + remove DOM 
    - callback function should not be part of the plugin itself
