3. JQuery basics
4. Let's build JQuery Plugins

---

## Chrome Advanced debugging
* Elements, styles and breakpoints
* Console
* Network
* Sources (page and extensions)

---

### Reversed engineering with dev-tools
target website: http://www.mima.co.il. find out:
* The (likely) web server programming language
* Are requests async / sync ?
* what other services the websites uses? (cdn, analytics etc.)
* How "random search works"?
* How "Search by User Input" works?


---

### Reversed engineering with dev-tools
target website: http://www.ynet.co.il/. find out:
* Which type of jquery version is being used?
* what is the domain for images?
* How would you improve the buttons section at the top of the page?
---


### JQuery basics - what is it?
* Write less, do more library
* Originally designed for cross-browsing
* Using Css-based queries
* Provide effective AJAX wrapper
* Since modern Browser are comply with standard and provide good DOM navigation functions - why should we use it?
---

### JQuery basics - why learn in at 2018?
* You most likely to bump into it online
* You most likely have to work with it, as it became long lasting standard for many projects
* Backward computability (designed for cross-browsing)
* May offer a good solution for some projects (mainly small projects)
* Support easy and fast-to-write UI solutions (JQuery UI)
* Good extensibility (plugins support)

---


### JQuery basics - adding to a project
* Adding JQuery (or any library) with CDN
* Adding JQuery as a file (minified vs unminified)
* A word about CDN
* The modern option: using a package manager

---


### JQuery basics - document.ready
To make sure the document is full loaded, we'll use document ready event
```js
$(document).ready(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});
```
Shorthand method
```js
$(function(){
   // jQuery methods go here...
});
```
Since entire page is loaded - JQuery script can be placed anywhere (event in the head section)

---


### JQuery basics - [selectors](https://www.w3schools.com/jquery/jquery_selectors.asp)

```
$("button").hide();         // hide all buttons
$("button.primary").hide(); // hide all buttons with class primary
$("tr:even").hide();        // hide all even tr's

// hide all links with target equals "_blank"
$("a[target='_blank']").hide();
// hide all links with target NOT equals "_blank"
$("a[target!='_blank']").hide(); 
```

[jQuery uses double quotes](http://contribute.jquery.org/style-guide/js/#quotes)


---

### JQuery basics - [Events](http://api.jquery.com/on/)
```js
$("p").on("click", function(){
    $(this).hide();
});
```
Or - shorthand version:
```js
$("p").click(function(){
    $(this).hide();
});
```
Triggering event:
```js
$("button:first").click();
```
