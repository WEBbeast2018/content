## WEBbeast Retrospective

***How can we make it better?***

---

### Continue Server practice: Recap
- We've created static server based on [Pure nodeJS](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Learn/Server-side/Node_server_without_framework)
- I've uploaded a [demo server](https://github.com/WEBbeast2018/class-practice/tree/master/m1.lesson5_6.flights-server-stage1) which meet the requirements fro stage 1. use it as a starting point.
- Don't forget to [PR](https://github.com/WEBbeast2018/class-practice/tree/master/m1.lesson5_6.flights-server-stage2)

### Practice: stage 1 - reminder
- create a server than can serve html, css, js, json files
- file can be accessed only if it's in `public` folder


---

### Practice: stage 2 - reminder
- work in teams of 2 people
- No. 1 will build Flights JSON generator (GUI determine date ranges, cities, how many entries etc.)
- No. 2 will build Flights JSON viewer (Flights table, sorting, time limit etc.)

### A few words about nodeJS
- modules - what are they, and what is "require"?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

- npm?
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

### Home Practice: build API server
* See [Routes section](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/), click on the first 5 GET requests to see the JSON responses
* Create a server which serve the first 5 request you've reviewed. response data should be identical.
* You can download and use [Posts JSON](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/posts) and [Comments JSON](https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/comments)

### Home Practice: build API server

* Bonus: add support for 'search' parameter for posts. it will return data items which include the provided string in their name OR body properties.
```
   	/posts?search=dinosaur
```
***Happy Hacking!***
