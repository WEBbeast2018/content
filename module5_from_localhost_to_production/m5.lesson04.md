(This document is optimized for presentation using [reveal-md](https://github.com/webpro/reveal-md))

---

### Prep
1. Create an account on heroku
2. Install Heroku CLI

### Agenda
1. Deployment
2. DevOps 
3. Deployment Environments
4. Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment
5. CI/CD with Heruko
6. Let's talk CI

---
### Deployment
Practice
* create repo for a node server (Don't forget process.env.PORT)
* Follow [Heruko getting-started-with-nodejs](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
steps 1-5

---
### DevOps
The process of Getting new Idea (new code) out to the world (production server).

DevOps Deals with connecting Development and Operation... what can be confederated as "Operation"?
* Everything between you and production: Build, Auto-Testing, QA etc. 
* Logs and Clients Feedback (Which prioritize task for next sprint)

---
### DevOps
DevOps should look for
- Re-work (deployment)
- Overhead (deployment complexity)
---
### [Deployment Environments](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Deployment_environment)
* ***Local*** - Developer's desktop/workstation
* ***Dev*** - Development server, where testing is performed by the developer
* ***QA*** -  where testing is performed by QA
* ***Stage*** - Pre-production, Mirror of production environment, display application to product team/roles before deployment
* ***Production/Live*** - Serves end-users/clients

---
### Continuous Integration, Delivery and Deployment
* ***Continuous Integration (CI)*** - Automated process which integrate code on each change (Commit)
* ***Continuous Delivery (CD)*** - The Capability to deploy an Environment at any given time
* ***Continuous Deployment (CD)*** - Automated process which deploy on each code change (Commit)

### CI/CD with [Heruko](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/getting-started-with-nodejs)
Make sure to use [process.env.PORT](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/15693192/heroku-node-js-error-web-process-failed-to-bind-to-port-within-60-seconds-of)

---
### CI/CD - Auto Deploy from master 
* Create / Fork [simple node project](https://github.com/WEBbeast2018/hello-CI-CD)
* Add auto deployment [connect to github](https://devcenter.heroku.com/articles/github-integration#automatic-deploys) (app dashboard > deploy > deployment methods)
* After connected to github repo, Enable Automatic deploys
* Test by merging a new PR

---
### CI/CD - Add Production Environment and Delivery on demand
* add new pipeline (my-app-deployment)
* production >  add app... > create new app (my-app-production)
* For deploying staging app to production click "Promote"
* See "Activity" Tab
* Test by merging a new PR, followed by promoting manually to production

---
### CI/CD - Add review apps
* from pipeline view "enable review apps"
* add app.json and commit to repo
* enable "create new reviews ... Automatically"

---
### CI/CD - [Add frontend project](https://medium.com/@ervib/deploy-angular-4-app-with-express-to-heroku-6113146915ca)
* Create / Fork [frontend project](https://github.com/WEBbeast2018/hello-CI-CD)
* Start the app. node local and production proxy configs
* Install express on frontend project, create simple static express server (don't forget process.env.PORT)
* Test your frontend server (build and serve)

---
### CI/CD - [deploy frontend project](https://medium.com/@ervib/deploy-angular-4-app-with-express-to-heroku-6113146915ca)
* Add a main entry in package.json
* npm start should point to server
* Add a postinstall entry in package.json
* Tip: use Production build flag
* Tip: use absolute path

---
### CI/CD - [deploy frontend project](https://medium.com/@ervib/deploy-angular-4-app-with-express-to-heroku-6113146915ca)
```js
{
  "name": "hello-ci-cd-frontend",
  "main": "server/server.js",
  "scripts": {
    "start": "node server/server.js",
    "dev-p": "ng serve --proxy-config config/production.proxy.json",
    "dev": "ng serve --proxy-config config/local.proxy.json",
    "build": "ng build --prod",
    "postinstall": "npm run build"
  }
}
```

---
### Let's talk CI
What we would like our integration service to do?
* Test
* Lint
* Build
* Integration Tasks and Tests


---
### Let's talk CI - Travis
* go to https://travis-ci.org/
* sign in with github, follow [these steps](https://docs.travis-ci.com/user/getting-started/#to-get-started-with-travis-ci)
* add .travis.yml
