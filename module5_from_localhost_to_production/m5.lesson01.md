2. Server and Client
3. Angular Dev and Prod
4. Angular AoT

### What and Why
The process of making source code ready to be serve on an environment (Dev, QA, Prod etc.)
* Shorten code (Uglification)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Bundling
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* Transpiling (Typescript, JSX, es6 => es5 etc.)
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* In modern framework - it is (mostly) mandatory
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->
* In Angular (and React) is based on webpack
<!-- .element: class="fragment" -->

---
### Server and Client
Since node code transform and cached to machine code by v8, 
In most cases there is not real need for server side build.

This can be done if needed - for example, to minimize data
transfer when updating the server (node_modules).

### Angular Dev and Prod
* [ng build](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/build)
* [The bundle files](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/42010893/what-these-angular-cli-do-inline-bundle-js-vendor-bundle-js-main-bundle-js)
* [Bundling & Tree-Shaking](https://github.com/angular/angular-cli/wiki/build#bundling--tree-shaking)
* uglyfication on production
* output-hashing
* source-map
